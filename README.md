> > A MoonBit-powered developer toolkit for building fast, compact, and efficient smart contracts on the Internet Computer.

# üåô moonbit-ic-cdk

A lightweight, WebAssembly-native Canister Development Kit (CDK) for building smart contracts on the Internet Computer (ICP) with the MoonBit language.

---

## ‚ú® Why MoonBit?

[MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/) is a programming language and toolchain optimized for WebAssembly (WASM), designed for modern cloud and edge computing. It compiles into compact, high-performance WASM binaries with exceptional compile-time and runtime efficiency.

### üöÄ Why MoonBit for ICP Canister Development?

- Existing CDKs for ICP, aside from Rust, are often immature and less performant.
- MoonBit is built for WebAssembly from the ground up, offering a **developer-friendly** and **lightweight** alternative with **better compatibility** and **easier learning curve** than Rust.

## üß± Project Structure

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of a MoonBit CDK for the Internet Computer. Current components include:

### üì¶ [`ic-types`](ic-types)
> Core ICP types and utilities  
Implements ICP primitives like `Nat`, `Number`, `Principal`, `Result`, and `LEB128`.

### üß¨ [`ic-principal`](src/ic-principal)
> MoonBit version of `ic-principal`  
Implements the `Principal` type and related utility functions, used for representing identities (users, canisters) on the Internet Computer.

### üß© [`ic0`](src/ic0)
> Wasmtime FFI bindings to the IC system API  
Enables direct low-level WASM interaction with the Internet Computer.

### üåâ [`ic0-api-warp`](src/ic0)
> Higher-level abstraction over `ic0`, inspired by Rust‚Äôs `ic-cdk::mod.rs`.

### üß™ [`example`](src/main)
> Working canister example written in MoonBit  
Demonstrates end-to-end deployment and off-chain interaction.

## üìà Project Status

- [x] Phase 1: Support for core ICP types and system API
  - [x] Support for `ic0` and `ic0-warp` APIs
  - [x] MoonBit canister example successfully deployed on the Internet Computer
- [ ] Phase 2: Extend CDK features for management canister api, inter-canister calls, json se/de serialization, etc.

‚úÖ **We are collaborating with the MoonBit core development team to jointly promote ICP adoption in the MoonBit ecosystem.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Follow these steps to install the MoonBit compiler, clone the CDK repo, build the example canister, and deploy it on ICP:

```shell
# install moonbit
# linux & macOS
curl -fsSL https://cli.moonbitlang.com/install/unix.sh | bash
# windows
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser; irm https://cli.moonbitlang.com/install/powershell.ps1 | iex

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eliezhao/moonbit-ic-cdk.git

# navigate to the example
cd moonbit-ic-cdk/src/main

# build with moonbit
moon build --target wasm --release

# deploy with dfx
dfx canister --ic install ${your_canister_principal} --wasm target/wasm/release/build/main/main.wasm
```
