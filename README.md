# MoonBit IC CDK

MoonBit is a programming language toolchain optimized for WebAssembly and designed for cloud and edge computing ￼. It produces significantly smaller WebAssembly binaries than existing solutions, delivering superior runtime and compile-time performance ￼. With a pragmatic, data-oriented design, MoonBit remains simple yet highly efficient ￼.

## Why MoonBit for IC Canister Development?

Current Canister Development Kits (CDKs) for Internet Computer (IC) development often struggle with WebAssembly compatibility and performance. This is especially true for languages other than Rust: while Rust has robust official support on the IC ￼, many other language CDKs are community-driven and less mature, leading to difficulties in building IC canister-based dApps ￼.

MoonBit addresses these challenges by being designed specifically for WebAssembly from the ground up. It offers a lightweight, developer-friendly alternative that avoids the overheads other languages face on the IC. Rust is powerful but is known for a steep learning curve in this domain ￼; by contrast, MoonBit’s simplicity can make it easier to learn and use effectively, without sacrificing performance.

## Project Structure
•	ic-types: Defines core data structures and types for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain ￼, along with related utility tools. (In Development)  
•	ic-principal: Implements the Principal type – a unique identifier for entities (users, canisters, etc.) on the IC ￼ – which is central to account and identity management in ICP. (In Development)  
•	ic0: Provides Wasmtime FFI bindings to the IC’s system API, enabling low-level WASM interactions with the blockchain.
