## 📖 Introduction

`moonbit-ic-cdk` is a MoonBit Canister Development Kit designed for the Internet Computer (ICP). It provides a complete set of API bindings and utilities that enable developers to build high-performance, compact smart contracts using the MoonBit language.

### Why MoonBit?

[MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/) is a programming language and toolchain optimized for WebAssembly (WASM), designed for modern cloud and edge computing. It compiles into compact, high-performance WASM binaries with exceptional compile-time and runtime efficiency.

**Advantages of MoonBit for ICP Canister Development:**

- 🚀 **High Performance** - Built for WebAssembly from the ground up, generating compact and efficient binaries
- 🎯 **Developer Friendly** - Easier to learn than Rust with clean and intuitive syntax
- ⚡ **Lightweight** - Low runtime overhead, perfect for resource-constrained smart contract environments
- 🔧 **Strong Compatibility** - Seamless integration with IC system APIs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/) compiler
- [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) (Internet Computer development toolkit)

### Install MoonBit

**Linux & macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.moonbitlang.com/install/unix.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm https://cli.moonbitlang.com/install/powershell.ps1 | iex
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliezhao/moonbit-ic-cdk.git
cd moonbit-ic-cdk
```

### Build Examples

```bash
# Navigate to example directory
cd examples/demo

# Build with MoonBit
moon build --target wasm --release
```

### Deploy to Internet Computer

```bash
# Deploy Canister (replace YOUR_CANISTER_ID with your actual canister ID)
dfx canister --ic install YOUR_CANISTER_ID \
  --wasm target/wasm/release/build/demo/demo.wasm

# Or use dfx deploy for local development
dfx deploy
```

### Core Modules

- **`ic0.mbt`** - Direct WebAssembly interface for interacting with the Internet Computer
- **`system_api.mbt`** - Provides convenient wrappers for common IC operations, inspired by Rust's `ic-cdk`
- **`ic_principal.mbt`** - Implements the `Principal` type for representing identities (users, canisters) on the Internet Computer
- **`candid_*.mbt`** - Complete Candid codec implementation including types, encoders, and decoders
- **`http_*.mbt`** - Types and utilities for building HTTP service canisters
- **`leb128.mbt`** - Integer serialization support for Candid

## 💡 Examples

### Basic Examples

Check out the `examples/basic/` directory to learn about core CDK features and API usage.

### Complete Example

The `examples/demo/` directory contains a complete Canister example demonstrating:

- Message handling and replies
- Principal retrieval and encoding
- HTTP request processing
- Candid serialization/deserialization

Run the example:

```bash
cd examples/demo
moon build --target wasm --release
dfx deploy

# For production deployment to IC mainnet:
# dfx canister --ic install YOUR_CANISTER_ID --wasm target/wasm/release/build/demo/demo.wasm
```
